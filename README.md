# PRODIGY_DS_02
Welcome to PRODIGY_DS_02 Repository! ðŸš€

In this repository, we take a deep dive into the world of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Our focus is on understanding the intricacies of the chosen dataset, with a spotlight on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

ðŸ“Š **Dataset**: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

**Objective:**
- Perform comprehensive data cleaning to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unravel insights, relationships, patterns, and trends within the dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Thorough data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers.
- In-depth EDA exploring the relationships between variables.
- Identification of patterns and trends to glean valuable insights.

Feel free to explore the code and analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the Titanic dataset and the nuances of data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

Happy coding! ðŸš¢ðŸ“ˆ
